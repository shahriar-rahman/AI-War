# AI-War
A graph-based territorial war game against a sophisticated AI, Klara.

## Abstract
Using the concepts of Graph-based AI traversal concept and Euclidean geometrical graph-transition algorithm, A sophisticated AI named Klara has been created. The success rate of Klara (AI) is 96.52% based on 115 games tested, which equals 111 wins by AI. Based on the 4 user wins, 2 of those wins came from a strategic trap score that resulted in a very close victory. 

## Rules
The general rule of this game is pretty straightforward. There are 24 Edges connecting 16 Nodes resulting in a total of 9 Rectangular Tiles (also known as Territory). 4 edges make up a Tile and the player to close the final edge (one Rectangular Tile or Territory) is awarded a point. The game continues until all Territories have been covered and the player with the most tile captured is declared the winner. A Screenshot of the Gameplay with UI has been provided for further clarification.
